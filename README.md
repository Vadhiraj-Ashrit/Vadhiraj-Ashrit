## Hi there 👋

I’m a data scientist and researcher with a strong background in AI, machine learning, and injury biomechanics. I completed my PhD in 2024 with a focus on AI-driven tools for pedestrian collision triage and emergency response. My work has had real-world impact, with implementations in German Police, Scotland Police, and the West Midlands Ambulance Service.

### 🔬 Research & Expertise
- PhD Thesis: In-Situ Triage of Pedestrian Collisions
- Focus Areas: Collision forensics, AI for post-collision care, injury prediction, and emergency responder support.
- Industry Collaboration: Work implemented by police forces and ambulance services to improve collision response.
- Patent Holder: For a novel approach in collision forensics.
- Published Work: 3 journals, 2 conferences, and featured in Crash Technology International.

### 💼 Professional Experience

With 8 years of industry experience before transitioning to academia, I bring practical insights to my research. I’ve collaborated with professionals and institutions including:
- Dr Christophe Bastien (PhD Supervisor)
- West Midlands Ambulance Service
- German Police & Scotland Police

Currently, I am working on advancing AI/ML algorithms for multimodal data analysis and exploring roles that push the boundaries of AI in natural language processing and therapeutic applications.

### 📈 Current Interests
- Artificial Intelligence for Active Safety
- Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)
- Automated Driving Systems (ADS)
- Natural Language Processing
- Multimodal Data Analytics

I am passionate about applying AI to real-world safety problems, and I am also exploring opportunities in the New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) space.

### 🌍 Future Directions

I’m looking to transition into leadership roles, where I can leverage my expertise to make impactful contributions. Whether it’s postdoctoral research, data science leadership, or consulting roles in safety and forensics, I am excited about roles that allow me to continue learning and solving critical problems.
